    printf("Hello\n");
    printf("Hello\n");
    printf("Hello\n");
    printf("Hello\n");
    printf("Hello\n");


*************Problems**************************

    Too much code

    Not scalable

    Not used in companies

*********************With Loop ****************
    for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Hello\n");
    }

***************Benefits***********************

    Clean code

    Easy to modify

    Industry standard

    Less bugs
