Loops & Iteration – Practice Questions

🔹 Question 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 100

    Write a program that:

        Uses a loop.

        Prints numbers from 1 to 100.

        Prints each number on a new line.

        📌 Hint: Use a for loop.

🔹 Question 2: Print Even Numbers Between 1 and 50

    Write a program that:

        Uses a loop.

        Prints all even numbers between 1 and 50.

        Uses a condition inside the loop.

        📌 Hint: Use % operator.

🔹 Question 3: Sum of First 10 Numbers

    Write a program that:

        Uses a loop.

        Calculates the sum of first 10 natural numbers.

        Prints the final sum.

        📌 Expected Output:
        Sum = 55

🔹 Question 4: Reverse a Number Using Loop

    Write a program that:

        Takes an integer number from the user.

        Uses a loop.

        Reverses the given number.

        Prints the reversed number.

        📌 Example:
        Input: 1234
        Output: 4321

🔹 Question 5: Count Digits in a Number

    Write a program that:

        Takes an integer number from the user.

        Uses a loop.

        Counts the total number of digits.

        Prints the digit count.

        📌 Example:
        Input: 5089
        Output: 4

🔹 Question 6: Check Prime Number

    Write a program that:

        Takes a number from the user.

        Uses a loop.

        Checks whether the number is Prime or Not Prime.

        Prints the result.

        📌 Note:
        A prime number has exactly two factors.

🔹 Question 7: Pattern Pyramid

    Write a program that:

        Uses nested loops.

        Prints the following pyramid pattern:

        *
        * *
        * * *
        * * * *


    📌 Hint:
    Outer loop → rows
    Inner loop → stars

🔹 Question 8: Fibonacci Series Using Loop

    Write a program that:

        Takes a number n from the user.

        Uses a loop.

        Prints the Fibonacci series up to n terms.

        📌 Example:
        Input: 5
        Output: 0 1 1 2 3

🔹 Question 9: Menu-Driven Program Using do-while

    Write a program that:

    Uses a do-while loop.

    Displays the following menu repeatedly:

    1. Add two numbers
    2. Subtract two numbers
    3. Multiply two numbers
    4. Exit


    Takes user choice.

    Performs the selected operation.

    Continues until the user selects Exit.

    📌 Important:
    Use switch inside do-while.

🔹 Question 10: Infinite Loop with Exit Condition

    Write a program that:

        Uses an infinite loop.

        Keeps asking the user to enter a number.

        Stops the loop when the user enters 0.

        Prints "Program Terminated" before exiting.

        📌 Hint:
        Use break statement.
