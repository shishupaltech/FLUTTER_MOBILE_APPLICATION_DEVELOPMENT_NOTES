Question 1: String or Number?

  Write a program that:

    Takes two inputs from the user.

    Stores both in String.

    Prints their sum as a number, not concatenation.




🔹 Question 2: int, double or num?

      Write a program that:

        Takes one input from the user.

        Stores it in a num variable.

        Prints whether the stored value is int or double.



🔹 Question 3: Precision Problem

   Write a program that:

        Takes a decimal number from the user.

        Stores it in double.

        Prints the number with exactly 3 decimal places.


🔹 Question 4: bool from User

   Write a program that:

        Takes one input from the user (true or false as text).

        Converts it into a bool variable.

        Prints the opposite value.



🔹 Question 5: Type Change with dynamic

   Write a program that:

        Takes a number from the user.

        Stores it in dynamic.

        First prints its type.

Then converts it to int and prints its type again.

🔹 Question 6: int Division Trap

  Write a program that:

        Takes two integers from the user.

        Prints:

        Their normal division

        Their integer division

🔹 Question 7: String Looks Like Number

   Write a program that:

        Takes one input from the user.

        Stores it in String.

        Checks and prints whether it is a valid integer number or not.


🔹 Question 8: num Mixing

   Write a program that:

        Takes one integer and one decimal from the user.

        Stores both in num.

        Adds them and prints:

        The result


🔹 Question 9: Nullable Confusion

  Write a program that:

        Declares a nullable integer.

        Takes input from the user.

        Assigns the value only if input is not empty.

        Prints the value safely.

🔹 Question 10: String to Number Decision

  Write a program that:

        Takes one input from the user.

        If it contains a decimal point, store it as double.

        Otherwise, store it as int.
