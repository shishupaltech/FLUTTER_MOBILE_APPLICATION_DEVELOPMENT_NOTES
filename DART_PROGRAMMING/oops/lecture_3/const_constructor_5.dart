// Constant Constructor In Dart
    // Constant constructor is a constructor that creates a constant object. A constant object is an object whose value cannot be changed. A constant constructor is declared using the keyword const.

//  Info
    // Note: Constant Constructor is used to create a object whose value cannot be changed. It Improves the performance of the program.

// Rule For Declaring Constant Constructor In Dart
    // All properties of the class must be final.
    // It does not have any body.
    // Only class containing const constructor is initialized using the const keyword.

// Example 1: Constant Constructor In Dart
  // In this example below, there is a class Point with two final properties: x and y. The class also has a constant constructor that initializes the two properties. The class also has a method called display, which prints out the values of the two properties.

    // Note: Here p1 and p2 has the same hash code. This is because p1 and p2 are constant objects. The hash code of a constant object is the same. This is because the hash code of a constant object is computed at compile time. The hash code of a non-constant object is computed at run time. This is why p3 and p4 have different hash code.
