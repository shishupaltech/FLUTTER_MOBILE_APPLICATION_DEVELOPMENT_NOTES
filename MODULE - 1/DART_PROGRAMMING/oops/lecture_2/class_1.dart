// Class In Dart
    // In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties and methods that an object will have. For example, a class called Dog might have properties like breed, color and methods like bark, run.

// Declaring Class In Dart
    // You can declare a class in dart using the class keyword followed by class name and braces {}. It’s a good habit to write class name in PascalCase. For example, Employee, Student, QuizBrain, etc.

    // Syntax
    // class ClassName {
    // // properties or fields
    // // methods or functions
    // }

// In the above syntax:

    // The class keyword is used for defining the class.
    // ClassName is the name of the class and must start with capital letter.
    // Body of the class consists of properties and functions.
    // Properties are used to store the data. It is also known as fields or attributes.
    // Functions are used to perform the operations. It is also known as methods.

// Example 1: Declaring A Class In Dart
  // In this example below, there is class Animal with three properties: name, numberOfLegs, and lifeSpan. The class also has a method called display, which prints out the values of the three properties.
 class Animal{
  String? name;
  int? numberOfLegs;
  int? lifeSpan;
  void display(){
    print("Animal name is ${name}");
    print("Animal has ${numberOfLegs} numberOfLegs");
    print("Animal lifeSpan is ${lifeSpan} year!");
  }
 }



// Example 2: Declaring A Person Class In Dart
  // In this example below, there is class Person with four properties: name, phone, isMarried, and age. The class also has a method called displayInfo, which prints out the values of the four properties.
  



// Example 3: Declaring Area Class In Dart
  // In this example below, there is class Area with two properties: length and breadth. The class also has a method called calculateArea, which calculates the area of the rectangle.



// Example 4: Declaring A Student Class In Dart
  // In this example below, there is class Student with three properties: name, age, and grade. The class also has a method called displayInfo, which prints out the values of the three properties.




// Key Points
  // The class is declared using the class keyword.
  // The class is a blueprint for creating objects.
  // The class body consists of properties and methods.
  // The properties are also known as fields, attributes, or data members.
  // The methods are also known as behaviors, or member functions.
// Challenge
  // Create a class Book with three properties: name, author, and price. Also, create a method called display, which prints out the values of the three properties.
